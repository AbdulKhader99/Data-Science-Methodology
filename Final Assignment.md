#For reference purpose
Which topic did you choose to apply the data science methodology to?

I chose Credit Card topic to apply the data science methodology

Next, you will play the role of the client and the data scientist.

Using the topic that you selected, complete the Business Understanding stage by coming up with a problem that you would like to solve and phrasing it in the form of a question that you will use data to answer. (3 marks)

You are required to:

Describe the problem, related to the topic you selected.
Phrase the problem as a question to be answered using data.
For example, using the food recipes use case discussed in the labs, the question that we defined was, "Can we automatically determine the cuisine of a given dish based on its ingredients?".

Problem:Issuing a credit card to a customer 
Questions to be considered:
1.Eligibility of the customer.
2.Current Financial status of the customer.
3.Background Information of customer.(Does he have any pending issue regarding credit cards or loans in the bank)

Briefly explain how you would complete each of the following stages for the problem that you described in the Business Understanding stage, so that you are ultimately able to answer the question that you came up with. (5 marks):

Analytic Approach
Data Requirements
Data Collection
Data Understanding and Preparation
Modeling and Evaluation
You can always refer to the labs as a reference with describing how you would complete each stage for your problem.

Analytical Approach: As the problem requires a yes/no answer we will use a classification model

Data Requirements:
Data required for this model to construct is customers background information,current financial status,eligibility to take a credit card,customer total transaction details.

Data Collection:
We collect the data from customer account in the respective bank,then we collect the data on customer financial status and data on customer eligibility and  background. 

Data Understanding and Preparation:
Data collected is then integrated and transformed into known variables.Removing null values and unknown values,then we finally get the processed data.We use this processed data to perform statistical analysis and correlation between the variables.

Model Evaluation:
Finally,we construct a classifier model to classify whether a credit card can be issued to a customer.Then,we evaluate this model for various inputs to get a suitable model with better accuracy.
